# One-Dimensional Inversion of Magnetotelluric Data Using Artificial Neural Networks

*Iyas Yustira, Imamal Muttaqien*

This project is a research in geophysical inversion modeling, especially in magnetotelluric methods using artificial neural networks. In this repository we show how to generate synthetic data, train the ANN model, and its implementation in magnetotelluric data inversion.

**Tools:**

* SimPEG
* Tensorflow
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
